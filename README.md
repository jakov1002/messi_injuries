# messi_injuries
I scraped Lionel Messi's injury record from Transfermarkt and analyzed it. 
I also uploaded it into a locally hosted PostgreSQL database and queried the uploaded dataframe 
with SQL. I included a .sql backup of the aforementioned database in this repository. 

The .sql backup file is the same one as in my "academy_final_project_code" repository 
because I uploaded the two dataframes/tables from that project 
and the one from this project into the same database.
